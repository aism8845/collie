- `scripts/suites/physics_material/run_rz3_permutations.sh`
  runs physics/material permutation cases from `inputs/legacy/2DN/suites/physics_material/permutations_rz3/`.
- `scripts/suites/physics_material/run_suite.sh`
  keeps the legacy case-based quick debug campaign in `scripts/suites/physics_material/cases/`.
